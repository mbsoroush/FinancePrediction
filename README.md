# LSTM-Based Financial Time Series Prediction ðŸ“ˆ 

This repository contains a project implementing LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks using TensorFlow to predict Google stock prices over a 10-day period.

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset
You could find the datase in my kaggle page:  
ðŸ‘‰ [Google Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mbsoroush/google-dataset)

## ðŸ“Œ Features
 -Uses LSTM, a powerful recurrent neural network (RNN), for time series forecasting.
 -Processes Google stock price data and predicts future trends.
 -Implements data preprocessing, normalization, and visualization techniques.
 -Utilizes TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly for analysis and visualization.

The project has two main parts ses LSTM, a powerful recurrent neural network (RNN), for time series forecasting:
1. **Model Training** â†’ Fine-tuning ParsBERT on a Persian emotion dataset using Kaggle GPU.  
2. **Streamlit App** â†’ An interactive interface where users enter text and get predictions in real-time.
