# LSTM-Based Financial Time Series Prediction ðŸ“ˆ 

This repository contains a project implementing LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks using TensorFlow to predict Google stock prices over a 10-day period.

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset
You could find the datase in my kaggle page:  
ðŸ‘‰ [Google Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mbsoroush/google-dataset)

## ðŸ“Œ Features
The fine-tuning of ParsBERT was done on Kaggle with GPU acceleration.  
Below are the main steps:

Uses LSTM, a powerful recurrent neural network (RNN), for time series forecasting.
Processes Google stock price data and predicts future trends.
Implements data preprocessing, normalization, and visualization techniques.
Utilizes TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly for analysis and visualization.
