# LSTM-Based Financial Time Series Prediction ðŸ“ˆ 

This repository contains a project implementing LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks using TensorFlow to predict Google stock prices over a 10-day period.

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available on my Kaggle page:  
ðŸ‘‰ [Google Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mbsoroush/google-dataset).

## ðŸ“Œ Features
-  Uses LSTM, a powerful recurrent neural network (RNN), for time series forecasting.
-  Processes Google stock price data and predicts future trends.
-  Implements data preprocessing, normalization, and visualization techniques.
-  Utilizes TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly for analysis and visualization.
