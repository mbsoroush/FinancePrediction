#LSTM-Based Financial Time Series PredictionðŸ“ˆ 

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks using TensorFlow/Keras to predict Google stock prices over a 10-day period.

ðŸ“Œ Features
Uses LSTM, a powerful recurrent neural network (RNN), for time series forecasting.
Processes Google stock price data and predicts future trends.
Implements data preprocessing, normalization, and visualization techniques.
Utilizes TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly for analysis and visualization.
